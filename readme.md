    This script is primarily designed to solve quadratic equations, the script uses a basic implementation of the quadratic formula to solve the question in hand.
    The script first assumes that the question in question is in general form, which is ax²+bx+c=0, where a, b, and c are real numbers and a is never 0.

  the quadratic formula, is: x=(-b±√b²-4(a)(c))/2
  it looks like this when written down:

  the program itself, just asks for the values of a, b, and c.
  for example a question like: x²+5x+1=0, in this case the co-efficient of x² is 1 since (x² = 1x²) after that we look at the next term, which is 5x, in this case we'll take 5 as the value of b. Finally as we can see the final term in the question is one, so we'll enter c as 1 in the program.

  after we enter the value of a, b, and c. we shall get our answer regarding the question x²+5x+1=0 as:

  x = -0.20871215252208009 or -4.7912878474779195
